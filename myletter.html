I worry occasionally when you're unhappy or sad, and I keep asking you what happened. I also consider ways to cheer you up so that you can smile once more. I don't know how I'll manage without you because I'm still a little child.You complete me after my parents no one else can match that It's a miracle Just like the sun makes the flower grow That's just the way you change my whole life.</p>
