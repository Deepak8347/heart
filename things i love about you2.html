  <h1>MY LOVE FOR YOU</h1>
  <div class="center">
    
    <p>I hope you know how loved you are. If you could view yourself through my eyes,</p>
    <p>you would be the most confident person in the whole world. You are my biggest blessing to love and be loved by you is a true gift.</p>
    <p>We have come a long way, from strangers to friends, to best friends, and now lovers. I have learned so much about you during this time. </p>
    <p>Your favorite animal is a cat. You prefer sunsets over sunrises. Your ice cream of choice is chocolate. Your love languages are words of affirmation and physical touch.</p>
    <p>You love being warm and hate being cold. You prefer farmhouse pizza, but most importantly, I have learned that you're kind, respectful, consistent, optimistic, a phenomenal lover, and so much more.</p>  
    <p>I hate the thought that you'll never see how incredible you truly are from my point of view, but I will always do my best to show you.</p>
    <p>We have built an unbreakable bond since day one, and you are the person that I choose to be with every single day for as long as </p>
    <p> heart is beating.</p>
